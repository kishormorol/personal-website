I am Md. Kishor Morol, working as a Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science, American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB).  I am also working as a Trainer (Coach) of AIUB ACM ICPC teams. I completed M.S. and B.Sc (Hons) in Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science, AIUB.

My research interest broadly lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and analysis of Algorithms. Specifically, I am interested in working on research problems which are related to machine learning, natural language processing, and algorithm analysis.

I love to write code with background music, read research papers and share my knowledge with students. During my free time, I like to travel new places and eat various foods.
