I am Md. Kishor Morol, working as a Lecturer at the Department of Computer Science, American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB).  I am also working as a Trainer (Coach) of AIUB ACM ICPC teams. I completed M.S. and B.Sc(Hons) in Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science, American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB).

My research interest broadly lies at the intersection of Artificial Inteligence and analysis of Algorithms. Specifically, I am interested in working on research problems which are related to machine learning, natural language processing, and algorithm analysis. 

I love to write code with background music, read research papers and share my knowledge with students. During my free time, I like to travel new places and eat various foods.
